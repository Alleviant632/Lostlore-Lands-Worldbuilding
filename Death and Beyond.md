# Death and Beyond

## Death

What if the difference between life and death was a little less dramatic? 

The act of dying feels painless—in fact, peaceful and numb. More transference than anything. The soft transformation from a physical being to a spirit.  When someone is actually actively dying, it is clear this is their end because they lose physical sensations and begin to see the spiritual plane. See the [Gods and Planes](<Gods and Planes.md) file for basic description.

## Shepherds

Shepherds walk the thin path between the material and spiritual planes, guiding souls to their place of rest. A few times over the years, rumors spread of a Shepherds Favor. A gift granted to a person who meets a Shepherd upon death and makes a deal. A sailor who requested immortality—whose spirit possesses the body of the one who defeated their last body. A mage who cannot die. A Toran who can call upon the aid of spirits.  


## Spirits

For spirits, existence is different. They can travel anywhere—the further from places they’ve been, the weaker they are. They cannot be as present and often seem like a wisp at best. To be apparent in the material plane is hard. It takes strength and power, yet many spirits have not trained and are satisfied. Spirits who can be witnessed have trained, have a desire to be present. They can see and interact with things on their side. If only those in the material plane could respond.
