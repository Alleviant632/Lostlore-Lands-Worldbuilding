# What is Kaleilea?

A beautiful flower with small buds and petals filled with so much color that the color seems to sink down through the stem to the ground. Kaleilea is so deeply infused with magic that it saturates the soil in such a way that nothing else can grow on whatever landmass it is. That would be generally fine if it were on an island. It covers an entire continent... 

It has to grow on land. 

So, while Puryvians have access to so much Kalielea, they need food—which is why they grow food on nearby islands. Kaleilea evolves based on the biome it grows on, and has “cousins” and “families” that make it different but similar across biomes. Sometimes, it forms sort of Kaleilea trees. Sometimes, it is little flowers, sometimes it is tall flowers (think sunflowers), sometimes bushes, etc. 

Running theory in my mind right now: types of Kaleilea effects are directly related/conflict with location. For example, Kaleilea that grows in the desert creates Leilink that produces water effects in Marks. I'm imagining they grow on cactus-like plants in these areas. 

# Biomes

There are several notable biomes, each of which grows a distinct variety of Kaleilea. In the North region of Puryvia in the Tasmarr mountains Mistral Kaleilea grows on large trees. It blooms only at midnight and is high-maintenance. Leilink produced with this is invisible. Rumors of its effects include wind and air control. A bit South in the lush forests of Floryvan, red, pink, and orange shades of Kaleilea grow on thick bushes.
