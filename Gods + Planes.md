#Gods and Planes

##Gods

Two gods balance the world between them, existing in harmony. One, the god of all things material. The other god of all that remains. Emotions, thoughts, echoes of the past. Death. They are as of now unnamed. There may be more entities but these are the two I have for now.

##Planes

Two planes encompass the gods domains. Spiritual and Material. Both blend together.

The spiritual plane is beautiful. A portrait of all that came before. New and different shades of colors none can see in life. 
Forgotten landscapes, rivers, streams, forests, mountains. All different than what is now. Creatures and people roam the lands, watching and wandering. Waterfalls spread across the world offer the thinnest veils between realms. Spirits mingle lazily around them, partly hidden by shallow mists.  

The spiritual plane is accessed through waterfalls.

The material plane is as you expect, physical.
