# Your Questions

## Gods

Are the gods worshipped in any way and does it differ between races/cultures? Are there shrines, rituals, prayers/songs, etc.? I think it would be really interesting to expand on this idea.

Besides the two major gods you mentioned as part of the worldbuilding, do other races/cultures believe in their own separate gods? Are there societies that disregard the two gods you mentioned?

This isn’t really a question, but I would just like to know more about the two gods in this world. How do they interact with the world? Are they very present, or more of a “fairytale” to the people living here?

Do they have emotions or compassion? Do they interfere at all with the living? What is their importance and role in the world (regardless of if that information is known to the people living there)?

Given that there is a god for both the material and what remains, are they the "basis" of this world? Are they seen as the "yin and yang", where one cannot be without the other? Are the Torans and Puryvians aware of this? Are any other species aware of this? Can anything in this world throw that harmony off?

Are they physical beings that people can see? Are they on another plane of existence? Are they lovers, siblings, coworkers? Is one aware of the existence of the other?

Given that your deities are opposites of one another, in the same vein as yin and yang, would it be fair to say that they are the same coin, somewhat like Janus, or are they truly, wholly separate? And, further, would the distinction between the two lead to significant theological debate, and sub-factions of belief, within your world?

## Spirits and Dying

For any reason, would anyone be BLOCKED from going through to this world? / waterfall? Like some unforgivable act in the living realm 

What is the big difference between dying in this world and dying in the real world? This is a big philosophical question, but something to consider. Some might argue that how you describe death here might be similar to how people experience dying in the real world. So, is there any other big difference (besides seeing the “spiritual plane”)? 

Are there any physical signifiers on the body when someone dies? Can someone differentiate between someone dying or someone having a seizure/heart attack? Some deaths are unpredictable, so is there a way for people to predict death in this world based on feeling? 

The "afterlife (is) on the same plane as the past"...what does that mean, exactly? Does it mean that when someone dies, they stay stuck in the same time they died in? Just thinking that that would be a cool idea, but also kind of confining, especially since your character inherits abilities from her dead family members

I would say that being a limbo type of space would create this reality of dead and undead interacting in a way that peaks the interest of everyone because they wonder what will happen if something offsets everything. ???

Does everyone believe in the Shepards/ the afterlife? Do some people believe in a different afterlife, or no afterlife at all? Do people grieve the same way we do? How is death explained to children?

Can anyone access the spirit world or only the Shepherds? 

Is the spirit world an actual physical place to go or is it like another universe that exists alongside this one and Shepherds can slip in between the physical and spirit world? I hope that makes sense lol. Is it like a Percy Jackson Mount Olympus situation or more like a "Heaven is all around us" kind of thing?

## Shepherds

How does one become a Shepherd? Is it a job you're chosen for, or a natural skill, or something else?

What do the people in the living world and spirit world think about Shepherds? Are they respected by everyone in both worlds, only by the ghosts, some other combination? And a minor follow-up, do the Shepherds have their own separate culture/lifestyles since they walk both worlds?

Are Shepherds treated differently amongst the different races and/or towns? 

Is this seen as a desirable position? Is this a job that is honorable or seen as more of a curse?

How are Shepherds chosen?

## Relics

What exactly are relics/artifacts? What is their purpose in this world? Are they only from a certain era or is it just any kind of magical object? 

Are there different tiers for the ancient relics? Do they all have the same amount of spiritual/magic power?

Are different ores relative to the amount of power these relics contain? Or is it based on the emotional power contained within the relics? 



## Puryvians

How did the Puryvians completely lose the native plants that granted them their magic and were so important to them? Besides losing land, are there any other reasons?

    Because some people hated their powers and sank their continent...

Do they have a scientific department working toward redeveloping their native plants? Is there any hope for the continent to be pulled out of the ocean? Magic is real after all. Would there be another plant that eventually evolves for a weaker version of their ink magic?

    Puryvians right now are extremely divided. Small islands leftover from the mainland of their sunken continent hold small settlements trying to survive and find     and grow their plants. A lot of them live on large boats and ships, they grow crops and have animals for food. These ships are mostly for comfort and living.       Some ships are built for speed. I will have a section on this, since there are two ships on my mind.

    Hess really wants to use magic and feels lost without it. Part of his storyline is him trying to grow these plants again or find new plants to use. Dani helps      him. There might be others, but Puryvians really don't like Torans--some more than others, some have no idea why they are supposed to hate them. More on this       in Lore or People.

### Tattoos

How does ink magic work? When the Puryvians use their tattooed ability, which seems be a one-time use, does the ink/tattoo disappear?

    I think about Henna as a fair comparison. Some easier spells don't fade quite so much. For example, Hess (in Characters page) has a small fire mark on the          tip/fingerprint of one of his fingers. When he touches something and wants to create fire with it, the thing catches a small flame of fire that could spread.       When he uses this, his finger gets burnt a little so there are slight scorch marks on his skin. The mark fades but does not fully disappear. I am honestly not      exactly sure how the whole system works. I think little marks and spells don't fade fully after one use. Maybe two or three. Puryvians can touch up their mark      and get more uses, but that uses "ink" which is rare now. He has a larger spell all over his forearm that looks like a storm. Lightning crackles almsot             animated, storm clouds move ever so slightly, the mark seems to glisten with dampness. Using this spell, he at one point points to the sky and the mark rises       up his arm and becomes real and goes to the sky and creates a storm around him. The mark is gone after use. I might change it to every spell has one use later      but I have not decided yet.

## Residents of The Forest

I'm deeply curious about the culture of the forest people. You have a lot of fleshed out information regarding the Torans of the granite orchard and the sea-faring Puryvians, but we don't even have a name for the forest-folk.

    I am going to make a page about the people, unfortunately I have not thought of a name for them yet (if they even have one). They rarely leave the Forest,          except when someone left...

## Magic?

How did such a difference in magic come about? Specifically, how the Torans have connection to the spiritual world/afterlife and the Puryvians are connected to native plants through tattoo ink. 

    This should be explained in the Lore section I will create

## "Races" and Distinctions Between People

Are there physical differences between Torans and Puryvians? Because you refer to them as "races." 

    Yes there are. At first I imagined them looking like specific races but I didn't want to jump in that wormhole. They all generally look like us in my mind.         Torans have pale lines and swirls on their skin and often have pale blue eyes. Puryvians often have tattoos, most of which are not magical now but they keep        them to stay connected to their roots in hopes they will be able to use magic again someday. They used to have purple eyes but now have dark grey eyes with         small flecks of purple. 

    (They look similar because...Torans are Puryvians. A lot of information was lost, both on purpose and accidentally, so Torans do not remember. I will probably      make a vague lore page with the very limited amount I know so far.)
