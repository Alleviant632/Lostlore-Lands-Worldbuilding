# Death and Beyond

## Death

What if the difference between life and death was a little less dramatic? 

The act of dying feels painless—in fact, peaceful and numb. More transference than anything. The soft transformation from a physical being to a spirit.  When someone is actually actively dying, it is clear this is their end because they lose physical sensations and begin to see the spiritual plane. See the [Gods and Planes](<Gods and Planes.md>) file for basic description.

## Shepherds of Souls

Shepherds walk the thin path between the material and spiritual planes, guiding souls to their place of rest. A few times over the years, rumors spread of a Shepherds Favor. A gift granted to a person who meets a Shepherd upon death and makes a deal. A sailor who requested immortality. A mage who cannot die. A Toran who can call upon the aid of spirits.

They wear long royal blue robes with embroidered patterns sewn with black, gold, white, purple, green, and orange thread. On the center of the chest a moon, shifting from certain angles into a bright sun. The sleeves are adorned with purple triskeles. The hood is black, shaped in such a way to resemble a raven's head. Many small flowers decorate the rest of the front, sleeves, and sides. 

They meet recently dead spirits who appear through the waterfall in a stone cavern. The Shepherd chooses the face of someone the spirit loved most, they appear as someone who has died. Few have seen a Shepherds true face.

## Spirits

For spirits, existence is different. They can travel anywhere—the further from places they’ve been, the weaker they are. They cannot be as present and often seem like a wisp at best. To be apparent in the material plane is hard. It takes strength and power, yet many spirits have not trained and are satisfied. Spirits who can be witnessed have trained, have a desire to be present. They can see and interact with things on their side. If only those in the material plane could respond. Few can see spirits. Certain rituals can summon them if the spirit wishes to appear.
