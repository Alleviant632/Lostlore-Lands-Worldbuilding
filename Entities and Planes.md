# Entities and Planes

## Entities

(they are more essence than entity if that makes sense) 

Two entities balance the world, existing in perfect harmony. Erutan (eh-rew-taun) created the physical world, the earth, seas, forests, mountains, creatures, peoples. They fell in love with the chaotic elements of nature, while comforted by the subtle simplicities of their creation. 

Rethe (reh-theh) saw this creation and mourned the passage of time, frustrated how things just ended. So they created the spiritual plane as a source of remembrance and continuation of life after its end. The spiritual plane exists in the same exact space as the material plane, but is only visible and habitable by those who have passed away and those who have been granted varying levels of access. Where you might see a mountain in the material plane, you might see a taller mountain with a different shape in the spiritual plane--a mark of the past. Where you see a stream, you might see a river. Where you see a valley, you might see a city lost to time. 

Erutan and Rethe are twins, at least this is how I envision them right now. They are both nonbinary in my mind, either possessing no distinct gender (probably Rethe) or representing all genders (Erutan). That might change.

It is well-assumed in the world that using magic pleases the entities, who may in-turn grant you benefits now or later. Benefits could be anything, a good day, a moment of good luck, tuned instincts in a moment of crisis, a piece of knowledge, a boost to magic, food and/or shelter conveniently found nearby, finding a person who could help you or to befriend, etc. There is no punishment (at least in my mind right now) for not using magic--the entities understand that for many access to magic is extremely limited (the Peryvians). The entities will be saddened and the person may feel varying levels of sadness or loss if they have not used magic or cannot. It would feel like something is missing within you, but the feeling is usually so slight you would have to dig deep to feel it. 

To clarify, Rethe is not the entity of the dead but does care for the spiritual realm. Both entities are rarely found, they often prefer to watch through parts of their creation. Erutan might exist within a tree, a plant, a bird, and many others--changing depending on their mood and desires. Rethe might do the same except through the spirits of these (and possibly the Shepherds). I'm still figuring out how the entities work and if I want more, so I'm open to suggestions and questions.

Erutan has gifted more people magic. They have bestowed magic upon Puryvians, Copesians, and Ruedenans. Torans are technically Puryvians, but Rethe began blessing them too. 

## Planes

Two planes encompass the entities domains. Spiritual and Material. 

The spiritual plane is beautiful. A portrait of all that came before. New and different shades of colors none can see in life. Forgotten landscapes, rivers, streams, forests, mountains. All different than what is now. Creatures and people roam the lands, watching and wandering. Waterfalls spread across the world offer the thinnest veils between realms. Spirits mingle lazily around them, partly hidden by shallow mists.

The spiritual plane is accessed through waterfalls.

The material plane is as you expect, physical.
