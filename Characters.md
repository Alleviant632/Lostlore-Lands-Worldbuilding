## Ilira 

(last name unknown, is in a language few understand now so interpretation is a part of the plot)

She just wants to be normal. Born and raised in Granite Orchard by her father, a deaf baker. Her grandmother left Spirit Springs after a conflict between her and the other Elders--Ilira died as a baby, her grandmother sacrificed herself using a relic to give Ilira a second chance at life. This is where Rethe's fascination with her begins. The relic her grandmother used, the Frozen Tear, was well-guarded in Spirit Springs as it has limited uses and they do not want people to use it. The Elders actively keep it hidden.
