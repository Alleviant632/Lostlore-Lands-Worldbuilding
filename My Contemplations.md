# My Contemplations and Deliberations

There are quite a few things I am unsure of so this section will be for me to brainstorm and have these things written somewhere. And it might help you see clips inside my brain as I vainly attempt to figure things out. If you have insights, questions, comments, etc about this let me know--it will help me a ton!

## My Initial Idea of How Things Decay

When things die, there is no decay afterward since things transfer into the spiritual plane. For people and animals, their bodies vanish (I imagine it seems somewhat pixelated but I have not fully developed this yet). Most plants and trees vanish as well, the stalks and roots vanish when they die but I imagine the disconnected buds remain--except this creates the assumption that fruits will vanish so eating most happen soon after picking so they must be fresh. Although, I do kind of like what this implicates so I might try to make it work. Special plants connected to magic behave differently

The concept of mushrooms conflicts with my original thoughts about how plants decay. I could say mushrooms and their appropriate families exist and reflect how Erutan and Rethe often work together. But so many concerns and questions spring up with this like what about animals? Can people use their meat, etc? What if most of a tree is dead but buds still grow? Ultimately, this would all require a lot of thinking so I am pushing that off until later.
