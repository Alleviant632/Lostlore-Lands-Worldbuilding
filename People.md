# Torans

Not their original name...but that knowledge has been lost to time (fortunately for them) and I have not thought that far ahead. 

They live on the Island of a Thousand Mountains in small settlements on the sides of mountains and in valleys--anywhere they can. They were Puryvians and used to live on that continent but do not remember. They do not remember that they fled, terrified of what some were planning and too cowardly to stand up against them. 

The first "Toran" settlers on the Island of a Thousand Mountains and many stayed near the three springs and the Waterfall. Rethe liked the community these people cherished and soon grew to love them. As soon as some Torans began to die, their spirits became visible to their living relatives. The spirits helped their families grow accustomed to this new land. Torans evolved to have these pale marks on their skin and their eyes became blue or pale blue. They used to see and speak to spirits, but as time passed they did not need their help anymore. Torans began to move away from Spirit Springs and eventually could not see these spirits anymore (the Waterfall is a source of great power and granted more powers). Most of their magic depends on proximity to the Waterfall (and other Waterfalls on the material plane, most of which they have never visited). 


# Puryvians

All that remain of a once-great continent. Across a vast ocean small islands separate the waters, the only remaining land from a sunken continent. In ages past, forgotten by time and buried records, the people here bear marks on their skin and purple eyes. Their skin soaked with a wealth of magic, Puryvians sketch designs on their skin as enchantments from ink derived from native plants now extinct. Upon use, the sketches fade. New designs must be drawn to cast a spell again. Now disconnected from their home, Puryvians sail the open seas in vast ships and float aboard houseboats—sometimes large enough for small towns. Some live on small islands near where the continent was. 

Their eyes, once saturated with powerful shades of purple, now bear colorless grey tones...with hints of purple. This is because their connection to their land is fading.

Erutan loved this continent when it existed and took great care to encourage the growth of this land. Their pride and joy was in their creation of Lorelea

# Copesians

Residents of The Forest. Spent centuries living near the Essence of Erutan (not the only essence but a strong source of power), the people within boast strong connections with all around them. Giant trees with open interiors for housing. Plants grow fuller and faster. Creatures play peacefully. 

The skin of Copesians often comes in shades of green and brown, their hair often colored like the leaves of autumn.  

At the center of The Forest thousands of redwoods grow (at least these are what I imagine, huge trees.). The largest one holds the Essence of Erutan, a vast ancient tree that still bears fruit. A ritual is completed for every Copesian as a sign of coming-of-age. They can now be trusted to use magic, they must first learn the costs. By plucking a seed from the Essence, Copesians get a fraction of Rethe's power. They hold these seeds close and plant them only when a Copesian finds the place they plan on staying forever. By planting the seed, they allow a tree to grow. As long as the seed lives, they have power. As the tree they plant grows, so too does their power. 

Erutan loves chaos, they love the wildness of their domain but they do love Copesians. Erutan tries to help when they can, but to be true to the forces of nature--they cannot help too much. They cannot guarantee a good result. Think chaos magic or wild magic in D&D. Say someone wants to create a river. They might succeed, yet there are so many possibilities of what could happen. Rain could pour instead, a storm might brew, ice might spread, so many good or bad things could happen.

# Ruedenans

Groups of explorers and inventors who seek out curiosities and create powerful inventions from powered stones and materials they found deep within mountains. Deft artificers and inventors, some long to learn more about how magic works—to find and archive relics. Perhaps even to make their own artifacts.

They live mostly within mountains and deep places full of curiosities. Their stature often reflects this and their eyesight is often poor. I have not developed them as much as the other and I am not sure if I want to even classify them differently.
