# Lostlore-Lands-Worldbuilding

  Welcome to the Lostlorn Lands, the series title I literally just came up with. 

  I'm going to try to put most of the worldbuilding stuff for this class in here so it is easier to access but bear with me. Some of you are familiar with places I'll mention and the people, but I will be creating and building out elements not included in my submissions last semester so I'm excited to get all your feedback! 

  I forgot what we're supposed to put here but I'll edit as needed. 

  Farewell, fellow travelers.
