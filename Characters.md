## Ilira 

(last name unknown to me)

She just wants to be normal. For as long as she could remember, Ilira has been able to see spirits. See, not communicate. Born and raised in Granite Orchard by her father, a deaf baker. Her grandmother left Spirit Springs after a conflict between her and the other Elders--Ilira died as a baby, her grandmother sacrificed herself using a relic to give Ilira a second chance at life. This is where Rethe's fascination with her begins. The relic her grandmother used, the Frozen Tear, was well-guarded in Spirit Springs as it has limited uses and they do not want people to use it. The Elders actively keep it hidden. 

Ilira is stubborn, protective, particular, and starts apathetic. She feels isolated, alienated because of her abilities and all she wants is a distraction. What she needs is a support system.

## Thessaly "Hess" Wayfinder

A Puryvian stowaway onboard the Crimson Compass, he is a talented artist. His greatest possession is his sketchbook, he would never abandon it. Abandoned by his family as a child when their homeship collapsed in a storm, Thessaly developed a deep fear of the sea. More specifically, storms. Eager to find a new home to explore and with nothing tying him to the Puryvian Isles, Thessaly snuck aboard the Crimson Compass--knowing they sought to find new land. 

He is dramatic, self-centered, and selfish. He has gotten used to being alone, not being responsible or connected to anyone else. "They always abandon me." He is also iconic.

## Vadania "Dani" Ahlstrum

A resident of the Forest, Dani left home to explore the world beyond. She carries a seed with her wherever she goes, waiting until she finds a place to dig roots. Has an affinity for a kind of magic akin to nature/earth/wild magic. 


## Keresen Groves

The sweetest person you will ever meet. No literally. The child of two lesbian farmers, Keresen was born in Spirit Springs and raised on an olive orchard. After certain catastrophic events in Granite Orchard, as well as the death of his sister, he leaves home to help out the nearby town. While in Granite Orchard, he meets Ilira and becomes her apprentice. 

He is kind, humorous, selfless, generous. 

## Zenthia Ignade

A Ruedenan, from deep inside the mountains on Foothill Island. Her people discovered gems with strange magical properties. Displaced and upset by the settlement of Tasmarrens after the Vanishment of Puryvia, she climbed out of her home and discovered a crack through the mountain leading to an orchard of granite trees. Moving into a cave in the center of the orchard, she set up shop caring for these unique trees and the glowing buds they grew. 

Considered odd to the townsfolk of Granite Orchard, she communicates through hand gestures and signs as is custom for Ruedenans--our of respect for the mountains.
