# Geography

Eventually, I will make a map. For now, these are the very basic land masses I have in mind. 

## The Island of a Thousand Mountains

Looking at a map, this island is on the right (think Africa's location). It is an incredibly large island with the intriguing premise of having countless mountains across its face. There are barely any beaches. 

### Spirit Springs

Many of the first Torans on the island settled on five mountains surrounding a brilliant waterfall that fell into three springs. Special herbs grew on these hills, each with their own specific uses. 

### Granite Orchard

Named, again, literally. This town/village is near to a literal orchard of granite "trees" This is where the beginning of the story occurs and all the primary characters meet up here or around here and they settle here (at least for now). This is Ilira's hometown. 

## The Forest

This continent is directly behind the Island of a Thousand Mountains, depending on where you are looking from. The island almost seems to hide the landmass behind it. The Forest is a large continent with tons of different biomes (I will have to do some research). At the outer edges, the trees are normal-sized but grow larger the futher in you go.

## The Lost Islands

I don't have a title for this yet, or most landmasses. This is the location where the Peryvians used to live before their continent was sunk and all knowledge and resources lost. Several small islands scattered about with varying levels of occupation. These were either islands before the continent vanidhed or were somehow protected and still remain. 

## Ships

I don't know where else to put this so here. There are a great many ships in the Peryvian fleets. Most of them are variations of houseboats. I don't imagine many Peryvians are pirate-like, but some certainly are. There are at least two notable ones in my mind that are plot-relavent.

### The Crimson Compass

I am rethinking a lot of the Crimson Compass right now and have not finalized how they fit in the world. Lead by the Archmage, a crimson-robed and masked Peryvian (you can tell by the eyes) committed to bringing power back to their people, no matter the cost. The Archmage also wants to discover the knowledge that has been lost, what happened to their people, who is to blame, and will punish whoever is responsible. Their hunt for powerful relics takes them across the world, they become curious about creating relics as well. The ship is fast and strong with a sturdy crew. 

### The Merry Ferryman

The boat itself is beautifully painted and well-kept. Not the fastest ship but a great one. Big and strong, she can hold a great many sailors. Music and laughter can often be heard upon her decks, subtle floral scents along with weed, food, drink, incense and more drift upon the wind. A hearty crew closely bonds as they go about their chores. Many members of the crew wear bright green robes with orange and yellow trim. Think a perfect blend of pirates, ninjas, and monks. 

Their captain? The sister of the Archmage. Our favorite crew member? Thessaly Wayfinder.
