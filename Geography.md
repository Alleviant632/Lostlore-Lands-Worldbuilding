## Foothill Island

An incredibly large island with the intriguing premise of having countless mountains across its face. There are barely any beaches. Also cold, except for some mountains closer to the center where mystical warm stones form. Home of Ruedenans and now "Torans" (Tasmarrens). 

### Spirit Springs

Many of the first Torans on the island settled on five mountains surrounding a brilliant waterfall that fell into three springs. Special herbs grew on these hills, each with their own specific uses. 

### Granite Orchard

Named, again, literally. This town/village is near to a literal orchard of granite "trees" This is where the beginning of the story occurs and all the primary characters meet up here or around here and they settle here (at least for now). This is Ilira's hometown. 

## The Forest

The Forest is a large continent with tons of different biomes (I will have to do some research). At the outer edges, the trees are normal-sized but grow larger the further in you go.

## Puryvia and the Puryvian Isles

The only thing left on the left side of the map after Puryvia Vanished is the Puryvian Isles, a few scattered islands where the entirety of Puryvian crops and animal husbandry is. Now, docks and homeships build out from the islands or make their own "towns" on the sea. 

## Ships

There are a great many ships surrounding the Puryvian Isles, home to many Puryvian families and small villages. On these homeships, families often have their own gardens and are often fairly self-sustaining. I don't imagine many Puryvians are pirate-like, but some certainly are. There are at least two notable ships in my mind that are plot-relavent.

### The Crimson Compass

I am rethinking a lot of the Crimson Compass right now and have not finalized how they fit in the world. Lead by the Archmage, a crimson-robed and masked Peryvian (you can tell by the eyes) committed to bringing power back to their people, no matter the cost. The Archmage also wants to discover the knowledge that has been lost, what happened to their people, who is to blame, and will punish whoever is responsible. Their hunt for powerful relics takes them across the world, they become curious about creating relics as well. The ship is fast and strong with a sturdy crew. 

### The Merry Ferryman

The boat itself is beautifully painted and well-kept. Not the fastest ship but a great one. Big and strong, she can hold a great many sailors. Music and laughter can often be heard upon her decks, subtle floral scents along with weed, food, drink, incense and more drift upon the wind. A hearty crew closely bonds as they go about their chores. Many members of the crew wear bright green robes with orange and yellow trim.

Their captain? The sister of the Archmage. Our favorite crew member? Thessaly Wayfinder.
