# What is Kaleilea?

A beautiful flower with small buds and petals filled with so much color that the color seems to sink down through the stem to the ground. Kaleilea is so deeply infused with magic that it saturates the soil and changes the various ecosystems it grows in.

Kaleilea evolves based on the biome it grows on, and has “cousins” and “families” that make it different but similar across biomes. Sometimes, it forms sort of Kaleilea trees. Sometimes, it is little flowers, sometimes it is tall flowers (think sunflowers), sometimes bushes, etc. 

Running theory in my mind right now: types of Kaleilea effects are directly related/conflict with location. For example, Kaleilea that grows in the desert creates Leilink that produces water effects in Marks. I'm imagining they grow on cactus-like plants in these areas. 

# Biomes

There are several notable biomes across the Puryvian continent, each of which grew a distinct variety of Kaleilea. In the North region of Puryvia in the Tasmarr mountains Mistral Kaleilea grows on large trees. It blooms only at midnight and is high-maintenance. Leilink produced with this is invisible. Rumors of its effects include wind and air control. (but also a lot of memory control. a lot)

A bit South in the lush forests of Floryvan, red, pink, and orange shades of Kaleilea grow on thick bushes. The heat and power from these flowers seep deep into  mines and caves nearby, pressurizing and forming minerals and metals. The Floryvan Forges are incredible feats of genius. Large masses of Leilink are processed and poured into Marks etched into the forge and cast great spells of heat. Floyvan was also known for their glasswork designs and is credited with inventing the Leilink pens used in current times. 

In the middle of the continent, a desert crosses the landscape. Cactus-like plants (or thin plants, I'm not sure yet) fill the area. These Kaleilea plants produce water and moisture. Seeping into the sandy soil, this type of Kaleilea provided the soil with nutrients necessary to grow crops. Here, large farms were built and fed a large part of the continent.  

I'm still workshopping other types of Kaleilea and other biomes. Maybe green Kaleilea in swampy areas? Please let me know if you get any ideas!!! The more colors/types the cooler it will be.
